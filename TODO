TODO

*write more complicated tests for Order class
*write tests for Item class
*write delete for Item and Order
*document input, output, expected function for Order and Item methods
*create class for ItemList---array vs linked lists
*once I have these things done I will be able to work on command line UI where we get input from
the command line and create/modify orders and item lists
*at that point I will need to figure out how to create a database of items and of orders and
how to interact with that database
*how to implement class methods (for example in Item class I want a class method to count total # of items)
