ORDR
Trck yr ordrs with ordr.


The Rationale
I currently work at an ophthalmology clinic and, like every other medical provider at this time, we struggle to keep an adeqaute supply of medical supplies and PPE. My best friend is tasked with finding companies to order from, placing ample orders, keeping track of these orderes, and distributing supplies to our 11 offices. While she uses printed documents/spreadsheets and carbon copies of her purchase orders (organized neatly in ~several~ binders) I believe we can further streamline this process. This is my attempt to make her life easier.

The Project
This project creates, tracks, and stores orders and their status from the command line. I have created classes to meet these needs and I intend to implement a SQL database to display her orders in interesting and informative ways (e.g. all orders within the past three months, orders containing certain eye drops, etc). A  final step would be to implement a very simple GUI for the ease of the user.

Technologies
C (because I hate myself) and in the future a SQL database. I will likey use GTK for creating the GUI though I will research my options more thoroughly after I have made headway with implementing the database.

One key component of an order is the list of items in the order. I have considered using an array vs. a linked list to store the items. I have decided to use a linked list as I anticipated needing to expand/shorten the list at will. Viewing a particular item on the list (and the time it takes to walk the list to find such item) is not a priority at this point. Furthermore I do not think lists will be more than 100 items long so walking the linked list will not take long due to the demands/constraints of this project. If, when I get to the point of displaying information with SQL queries, the linked list is not sufficient then I will switch to using arrays. I believe this transition will be easier than going from array->linked list.

Problems
1. I do not have experience using a database with another programming language. In my database class we worked only with files of SQL queries. I anticipate challenges setting up the database, implementing it with C, and writing complex queries to display information.
2. I hate front end development and will be quite displeased to implement at GUI.
3. I have very little experience with OOP.

Installation
Don't install at this time, nothing much to look at yet.
