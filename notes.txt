Notes

General
* malloc vs object constructor--how to use?

for README
* add linked list vs array discussion (remove from ItemList.c)


for Item/ItemList
// add check to make sure no item of same name exists already
// if it already exists increase quantity of existing item by one
// returns void
// what is the flow to make a new list and new item
// create new list
// create item based on name,price, quantity
// add existing item to list
// this means if there is already an item with same name we will waste
//    space/time by creating new item, then updating existing item, then deleting new item
// when do we check for existing items??



for Item and Order
* Extra functions may need to be reworked or removed



for ItemList
* need to update add_item and remove_item
